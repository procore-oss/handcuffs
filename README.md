# Handcuffs

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/procore/handcuffs.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/procore/handcuffs)

Handcuffs provides an easy way to run migrations in phases in your [Ruby on
Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) application.

To configure, first create a handcuff initializer and define a configuration

```ruby
# config/initializers/handcuffs.rb

Handcuffs.configure do |config|
  config.phases = [:pre_restart, :post_restart]
end
```

Then call `phase` from inside your migrations

```ruby
# db/migrate/20160318230933_add_on_sale_column.rb

class AddOnSaleColumn < ActiveRecord::Migration

  phase :pre_restart

  def up
    add_column :products, :on_sale, :boolean
  end

  def down
    remove_column :products, :on_sale
  end

end
```

```ruby
# db/migrate/20160318230988_add_on_sale_index

class AddOnSaleIndex < ActiveRecord::Migration

  phase :post_restart

  def up
    add_index :products, :on_sale, algorithm: :concurrently
  end

  def down
    remove_column :products, :on_sale
  end

end
```

You can then run your migrations in phases using
```bash
rake 'handcuffs:migrate[pre_restart]'
```
or
```bash
rake 'handcuffs:migrate[post_restart]'
```

You can run all migrations using
```bash
rake 'handcuffs:migrate[all]'
```

This differs from running `rake db:migrate` in that specs will be run in the
_order that the phases are defined in the handcuffs config_.

If you run a handcuffs rake task and any migration does not have a phase
defined, an error will be raised before any migrations are run. To prevent this
error, you can define a default phase for migrations that don't define one.
```ruby
# config/initializers/handcuffs.rb

Handcuffs.configure do |config|
  config.phases = [:pre_restart, :post_restart]
  config.default_phase = :pre_restart
end
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'handcuffs'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install handcuffs

## Running specs

The specs for handcuffs are in the dummy application at `/spec/dummy/spec`. The
spec suite requires PostgreSQL. To run it you will have to set the environment
variables `POSTGRES_DB_USERNAME` and `POSTGRES_DB_PASSWORD`. You can then run
the suite using `rake spec`
